# QA Manual & API Testing – E-commerce Dynamic Search Feature

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **end-to-end manual and API testing** of a newly proposed
**dynamic search feature** for a shoe-selling e-commerce platform.

The objective was not only to test functionality but also to deeply understand business
requirements, validate edge cases, and ensure the feature delivers a smooth user
experience.

## Scope of Testing
- Search bar behavior validation  
- Keyword matching logic (partial & fuzzy search)  
- Handling typos, synonyms & word order  
- UI–API data consistency  
- Edge cases: no result scenarios, special characters

- Partial keyword matching  
- Typo handling  
- Synonym recognition  
- Word order flexibility  
- Result display behavior

## API Testing
Postman collection & reports are stored in:

api-testing/ecommerce-shoe-store.postman_collection.json
api-testing/api-test-report.xlsx


Validated:
- Response accuracy  
- Filtering logic  
- Status codes  
- Pagination & error handling

## Key Findings
- Partial keyword matching is inconsistent  
- Incorrect behavior for typo-based queries  
- No fallback logic for synonym searches
